Step 1: Import Excel file using EXCEL node from SOURCE palette.

Step 2: Observe the data using TABLE node from OUTPUT palette.

Step 3: Add PARTITION node from FIELD OPS palette.

Step 4: Set the percentage of training data and testing data as well as seed.

Step 5: Observe the partitioned data using TABLE node from output palette.

Step 6: Add SELECT node to separate training data and discarding testing data and vice versa.

Step 7: Provide the condition to separate the data.

Step 8: Add type node to read the values and set the role as target for specific field.

Step 9: Add C5.0 model node to the canvas from MODELLING palette.

Step 10: Set the target and input fields and run it.

Step 11: Hence models are obtained and analyze it.

Step 12: Now we need to check the accuracy of the model of both training and testing data set.

Step 13: We add ANALYSIS node from OUTPUT palette.

Step 14: We set the threshold value.

Step 15: If the correctness of model is more than the threshold value and AUC is more than 0.5, then we have obtained a good model otherwise some changes are need to be done for the same.
